# Mangata & Gallo - Homepage

This project is for the HTML & CSS in Depth course that is part of [Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer)

## About Project

The prjoject consisted of developing a home page with a header, main content and footer for a fictional company. I had to decide whether on using a grid or flexbox layout for the home page. 

The requirements were a header that contained the client logo and the main content should be a large promotional banner with three columns with text and images below it. The footer should have two columns: the first column should have a small logo and the second one should have copywriting information. Styling, should have the appropriate look and feel for the client's target audience.
